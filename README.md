# K-Map-Solver
Program that delivers the simplified Boolean expression for K-Maps of up to 3 variables and prints their maps.

The program takes the file path of an input file. The first line in the input file should be the number of following lines.
Each following line starts with the number of variables, followed by the number of minterms, followed by the minterms. 
The attached "input.txt" file is a sample input file. 
The program then creates an output file in the same directory as the input and prints into it each K-map and the simplified boolean expression.
